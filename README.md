# High-Order WaveFront Sensing and Control (HOWFSC) on Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC ZCU104

Welcome to the High-Order WaveFront Sensing and Control (HOWFSC) project repository! This project demonstrates the implementation and Performance Evaluation of advanced wavefront sensing and control algorithms on the Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC ZCU104 board using High-Level Synthesis. 

## Control Algorithms Kernels 
In this work, we accelerate the bottleneck operations in the Electric Field Conjugation (EFC) and Jacobian Estimation

- **Reference Kernels**: A simple reference HLS implementations of vector addition and FFT kernels with both HLS and software implementations.
Including Timing reports and block diagrams.

- **2D FFT**: HLS Implementation and performance analysis of 2D FFT kernel. Including Timing reports and design.
- **Angular Spectrum Propagation**: HLS Implementation and performance analysis of Angular Spectrum Method. Including Timing reports and design diagrams.
- **Matrix-Vector Multiplication (MXV)**: HLS Implementation of Matrix-vector inner product kernel.

- **MFT**: Matrix Fourier Transform (in progress)
- **Optical Modeling**: System Integration (in progress)
