# High-Order WaveFront Sensing and Control (HOWFSC) on Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC ZCU104

Welcome to the High-Order WaveFront Sensing and Control (HOWFSC) project repository! This project demonstrates the implementation of advanced wavefront sensing and control algorithms on the Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC ZCU104 board. 

## Features

- **1D FFT**: Implementation and performance analysis of 1D FFT algorithms.
- **2D FFT**: Implementation and performance analysis of 2D FFT algorithms.
- **Vector Addition (VADD)**: A simple reference vector addition kernel with both HLS and software implementations.
- **Matrix-Vector Multiplication (MXV)**: Matrix-vector inner product kernel implementations.
- **MFT**: Matrix Fourier Transform (in progress)
- **Optical Modeling**: System Integration (in progress)
